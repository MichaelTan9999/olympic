# Olympic - an iOS app introducing the Olympic Games

This app is made under the one of the instructions of the Comprehensive Design Course of the *School of Information and Software Engineering (SISE)* of *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)*, of which the supervisor is Yue, Feng.

## Architecture

The app is quite simple and written in Swift 5 and Swift UI. I use a json file to store the static contents.

## Why I made this

The reason that I make this project is that I want to help those who chooses the same topic like me for the Comprehensive Design Course. When I chose the project for my first Comprehensive Design Course, I did not have a skill stack and thus I found it extremely difficult. Considering that you may also encounter the problem I met and the development of Swift and iOS app architecture is **really superfast**, I decide to make an app for you, for saving your time on understanding the swift and the structure of the apps.
