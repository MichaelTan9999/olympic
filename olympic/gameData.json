Although at the beginning women were authorised to participate in only some events, today their programme is almost identical to that of the men.\n\nThe 1960s saw a boom in athletics in developing countries, with the success of African runners and sprinters of Caribbean origin. Americans have for a long time reigned over men’s athletics, although European nations have also dominated. For the women, the Soviet Union and the GDR (East Germany) dominated the competitions before their dissolution.\n\nMore recently, high-level Asian athletes have risen up the ranks.

In 2000, the Sydney Games witnessed the entrance of synchronised diving on both the springboard and the platform.\n\nThis discipline was firstly dominated by the USA. This domination started to waiver with the participation of China at the end of the 1980s. When the American Greg Louganis, who is considered as the greatest diver ever, was still in competition, the Chinese managed to achieve some victories. Since Louganis retired, China has dominated the men’s events. Lately, China’s women divers have proved themselves unbeatable."
